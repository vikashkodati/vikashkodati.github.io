      <p>
        My Service to IITG Alumni via IIT Guwahati Alumni Association during the
        period 2022 -- 2024
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of my journey is a passion for building communities that
        inspire and uplift. I believe in creating spaces where alumni has
        access to equitable opportunities, regardless of their background. For
        me, the true reward lies not in competition but in fostering a deep love
        for learning and growth. This approach drives everything I do, from
        supporting alumni initiatives to nurturing the next generation of
        innovators, and investors from within the IITG family.

      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past two years, my work with the IIT Guwahati Alumni
        Association (IITGAA) has been about building a foundation that lasts. We
        established the first-ever legal entity for IITGAA in the U.S., creating
        a structure that allows us to receive tax-deductible donations. This was
        more than just paperwork; it was about enabling a sustainable future
        where alumni contributions directly support our alma mater.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve also focused on fostering entrepreneurship within our alumni
        network. We partnered with TechSoup to offer discounts on technology and
        services, helping alumni leverage tools that might otherwise be out of
        reach. Although our application for a $50,000 AWS grant didn’t succeed,
        we are in the process of securing recurring nonprofit grants, ensuring
        ongoing support for our initiatives on AWS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our efforts to organize webinars not only provided knowledge-sharing
        opportunities but also empowered alumni by giving them a platform to
        moderate these sessions. This isn’t just about learning; it’s about
        leadership and making sure our alumni are at the forefront.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the financial realm, I spearheaded the creation of long-term
        endowment funds and established a process where the batch celebrating
        their Silver Jubilee leads the fundraising efforts for that year.
        Additionally, I built the tax-exempt infrastructure needed to handle
        donations and payments efficiently, whether at conferences or online. We
        now have physical credit card machines (Zettle) for onsite donations,
        making it easier for alumni to contribute.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my priorities has been transparency and engagement. I started
        sharing quarterly reports to keep everyone informed, making sure the
        work we do is visible and accountable. These reports weren’t just about
        numbers; they were about trust and showing that every contribution, big
        or small, is being put to work efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the PanIIT Conference, I represented IIT Guwahati, strengthening
        relationships with key PanIIT leaders. These connections are crucial for
        expanding our influence and opportunities across the broader IIT alumni
        network.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also worked to align IITGAA with other IIT alumni associations,
        discussing the creation of a separate foundation to support our
        activities. This involved multiple meetings with alumni across different
        <b>IITs (Madras, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Bombay, BHU, Roorkie)</b>,
        where we talked about governance, election processes, and the
        relationship between the Alumni Association and the proposed foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus has always been on individual alumni. Whether it was helping
        someone find like-minded individuals for a startup, navigating contract
        issues, or simply making the right introductions, I’ve been there,
        building relationships that matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, along the way, serving in this position also led me to explore
        the broader support structures available for both nonprofit and
        for-profit organizations. I discovered resources like grants, cloud
        services, human resources, donor networks, tax exemptions, and systems
        that manage all these aspects effectively. This opened up a new
        perspective for me—not just on how to support nonprofits, but also how
        to run a profitable business. Many of the organizations I engaged with
        offered programs for both nonprofit and for-profit ventures, and that
        encouraged me to explore both pathways in parallel.
