      <h2>WHY I did WHAT I did</h2>
      <p>
        My journey as Treasurer/CFO for IITGAA was more than just a role; it was
        a mission to build a lasting, empowering community for IIT Guwahati
        alumni. I believe a strong community is like a spacecraft—a vessel that
        can lift individuals beyond their current horizons, powered by a
        collective force. For me, the heart of this mission was to create a
        space where alumni could drop their competitive instincts, embrace
        support, and truly connect over shared experiences and aspirations.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary motivation was to bring alumni together as a marketplace of
        shared skills, wisdom, and support. I envisioned a space where alumni
        could find opportunities as founders, advisors, investors, consultants,
        and speakers within the IITG family. Each interaction, each piece of
        advice shared, would create a network effect, like the gravitational
        pull that holds a galaxy together, allowing alumni to benefit from one
        another’s strengths. This “rising tide” approach became a driving force
        in my work, aiming to lift the entire IITG family—students, faculty, and
        alumni—through a collaborative spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this role, I discovered numerous for-profit and nonprofit support
        structures that could amplify our impact, including grants, cloud
        services, and donor networks. Engaging with these resources revealed how
        such systems could strengthen both nonprofit and business efforts. This
        insight didn’t just support my work for IITGAA; it inspired me to lay
        the groundwork for my own venture in the space industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this journey, I have come to see community as the fuel that
        powers our IITGAA mission. By bringing alumni together in a supportive,
        transparent, and resource-rich environment, we create a legacy that
        transcends individual efforts. As our work continues, I’m inspired by
        the potential of each alumnus to contribute meaningfully, lifting the
        next generation and pushing the boundaries of what our IITG family can
        achieve together.
