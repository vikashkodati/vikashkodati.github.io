        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Over the past two years, my work with the IIT Guwahati Alumni Association (IITGAA) has been about building a
            foundation that lasts. We established the first-ever legal entity for IITGAA in the U.S., creating a
            structure that allows us to receive tax-deductible donations. This was more than just paperwork; it was
            about enabling a sustainable future where alumni contributions directly support our alma mater.</p>

        <p>One of my priorities has been transparency and engagement. I started sharing quarterly reports to keep
            everyone informed, making sure the work we do is visible and accountable. These reports weren’t just about
            numbers; they were about trust and showing that every contribution, big or small, is being put to work
            efficiently.</p>

        <p>I’ve also focused on fostering entrepreneurship within our alumni network. We partnered with TechSoup to
            offer discounts on technology and services, helping alumni leverage tools that might otherwise be out of
            reach. Although our application for a $50,000 AWS grant didn’t succeed, we secured recurring nonprofit
            grants, ensuring ongoing support for our initiatives.</p>

        <p>Our efforts to organize webinars not only provided knowledge-sharing opportunities but also empowered alumni
            by giving them a platform to moderate these sessions. This isn’t just about learning; it’s about leadership
            and making sure our alumni are at the forefront.</p>

        <p>In the financial realm, I spearheaded the creation of long-term endowment funds and built the tax-exempt
            infrastructure needed to handle donations and payments efficiently, whether at conferences or online. We now
            have physical credit card machines (Zettle) for onsite donations, making it easier for alumni to contribute.
        </p>

        <p>At the PanIIT Conference, I represented IIT Guwahati, strengthening relationships with key PanIIT leaders.
            These connections are crucial for expanding our influence and opportunities across the broader IIT alumni
            network.</p>

        <p>I also worked to align IITGAA with other IIT alumni associations, discussing the creation of a separate
            foundation to support our activities. This involved multiple meetings with alumni across different IITs,
            where we talked about governance, election processes, and the relationship between the Alumni Association
            and the proposed foundation.</p>

        <p>Finally, my focus has always been on individual alumni. Whether it was helping someone find like-minded
            individuals for a startup, navigating contract issues, or simply making the right introductions, I’ve been
            there, building relationships that matter.</p>
