                <h1 class="text-center">Investment Thesis</h1>
                <p>
                    As an <span class="highlight">angel investor</span>, I focus on identifying early-stage opportunities in the <span class="highlight">space technology sector</span>. My approach is centered on supporting visionary founders who are tackling complex challenges in this growing industry. Over time, I have been developing a strong investment thesis around space startups, as I believe this sector holds enormous potential for innovation and long-term value creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While space technology remains my core focus, I am also open to investing in promising startups across various other sectors when the right opportunity presents itself. Flexibility in approach allows me to diversify my portfolio while staying true to my primary investment philosophy.
                </p>

                <h2>Real Estate Ventures</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to angel investments, I also engage in <span class="highlight">real estate investments</span>. Along with a close group of friends, we pool our resources to acquire residential properties. Our strategy involves purchasing homes and renting them out, aiming for <span class="highlight">positive cash flow</span> from rental income. This hands-on involvement in real estate ensures a stable cash-generating asset in my overall investment strategy.
                </p>

                <h2>Entrepreneurship and Investing</h2>
                <p>
                    I strongly believe that <span class="highlight">entrepreneurship and angel investing</span> are inherently interconnected. Entrepreneurs, with their deep understanding of business operations and challenges, often make excellent angel investors. The ability to recognize innovation, navigate risks, and offer strategic guidance is what connects both worlds, enabling me to provide not only capital but also mentorship to the startups I support.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal is to continue building a balanced and diversified investment portfolio, focusing on space technology while remaining open to opportunities in real estate and other innovative sectors.
