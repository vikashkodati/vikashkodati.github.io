I kick start the projects by understanding the current state of affairs by going through diagrams at various levels of abstraction and talking to various teams responsible for each application/system in the echo system of T-Mobile. Having discussed the high level requirements with the executives and the business team, I prepare the TOBE blueprints, evaluate the risks, and propose multiple solutions along with the cost involved in each solution. I then conduct the design sessions, drive consensus and then have teams create low levels designs from the TOBE architecture artifacts followed by the development phase. I perform code reviews at a high level to ensure the functionality was implemented in the way it is supposed to. For all these projects I also look after the nonfunctional aspects like Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Security, Compliance, Logging monitors among other things. I work with the project managers to reflect accurate information in the executive reports in addition to working with the vendors as and when required.</li>

By taking the “Work In Progress” into consideration, this solution helps reassign resources based on workload (WIP), skillset, geography, availability, meeting duration and product line in addition to managing the end to end customer engagement. The project involved developing a web application for the business user and a constraint propagation engine in the backend that used JaCOP (java library) to capture the business rules and apply them at run time. We architected the solution to be deployed on two different JVMs (one for application and other for engine) and used Spring Data JPA for persistence.</li>

Effective December 22, 2004, all fee payments for compliance supervision had to be collected by Ameriprise and paid to the RP.  In order to comply with this NASD requirement, we automated the calculation and payment of P2 compliance supervision fee based on GDC and risk factors, supported notification process to P2 advisor/agent. This also involved designing the regulatory span-of-control and RP delegation structure where we store the relationships between Agent to Full, Functional and OutOfOffice delegates and the ability to track changes on these relationships.</li>

    <li><b>Summary & Role:</b> The compensation management functions of the Distribution Management Utility (DMU) are constrained by the legacy system Field Administration & Compensation Tracking System (FACTS), which contains information about compensation (eligibility or CE) plans and hence making it very costly and time consuming to add new, or change existing, compensation plans. It also contributed to service interventions and recoveries and dissatisfied distributors.  With the proven success of DCM and given that the broker/dealer has many growth, retention, recruitment, and expense reduction aspirations and initiatives; with many of these initiatives impacting compensation, and with the need to market them quickly we migrated all the existing active plans from FACTs making DCM the single source of truth for all compensation information across all products and lines of business. In addition to this, we also delivered a framework/foundation to enable greater flexibility, increased speed to market, and reduced costs for all future compensation initiatives resulting in time savings between 5-18 months and cost avoids of $1MM to $1.9MM. </li>

    <li><b>	Summary & Role:</b> Financial Services Center was a new business unit introduced to complement the existing P1 and P2 platforms at Ameriprise, by leveraging existing distribution capabilities. Performed the cost benefit analysis of spinning this business as a new platform vs. an existing one like P1. Collectively decided to create a new distribution channel in DCM offering capabilities like measuring non-field sales, accumulate GDC per agent, ensure agent is appropriately credentialed and enable monitoring by the registered principle (RP). The compensation plan supported normal and overtime payments for the agents along with team bonuses while manager received quarterly and yearly bonuses. Owing to compliance deadlines, we built and delivered the core part of the project within 5 months and helped the new division.</li>

    <li><b>Summary & Role:</b> The existing custom report generation process in DCM was taking up significant chunk of the nightly batch processing window.

    <li><b>	Summary & Role:</b> With the growth of Ameriprise business new tasks and responsibilities were defined for P1 advisors which determined their “Exempt” (salaried) status. The scope of the project was to systematically calculate hourly wages and overtime pay for Non-Exempt P1 and P4 advisors based on the submitted timesheets. We integrated the system with HR Peoplesoft to enable the flow of hours and implemented the necessary compensation plans (scorecards) for paying out Non-Exempt advisor bonus and Milestone performance bonus which kick in after the 5th service period and lasts till the 26th after which, the advisors automatically are “Exempt.” This project also replaced existing California-specific Level One compensation programs with the above defined national non-exempt programs.</li>

    <li><b>	Team Size:</b> 50+ (Ameriprise IT + Infosys + Trilogy)</li>
    <li><b>	Summary & Role:</b> The footprint of DCM increased at Ameriprise over time and many business units moved their compensation processing onto the system that eventually increased the size of the database to a level where it started affecting the daily operations and performance. We implemented the archiver whose job was to maintain only 2 years’ worth of data in the production database and archive the rest to an offline database. A one-time process was created to archive the data upfront and bring it to a manageable size and another process was created to execute to archive data periodically along with error handling and disaster recovery processes. The complexity of this task lied in determining the objects to be pulled out in a safe manner w/o losing data integrity and also make the same data available upon request. The other aspect was to keep the schemas of both these databases in sync.  Since this affected every business unit using DCM, we had to device a good proactive communication strategy and ensure their business ran as usual. The project took 700 days and improved the daily batch process performance from 28hrs to 18hrs.</li>

    <li><b>	Team Size:</b> 50+ (Ameriprise IT + Infosys + TCS + Trilogy)</li>
    <li><b>	Summary & Role:</b> Upgraded DCM for Ameriprise a couple of times from 3.3 to 3.8 in 2008 and again from 3.8 to “DCM 2011” in the year 2012. Every upgrade involves ensuring the existing functionality and customizations continue to work in addition to the new functionality that is introduced as part of the new version. The upgrade in 2012 was by far the most complex that we handled since it involved migrating the existing data to conform to the standards of NIPR, which is national database of produce/advisor/agent information like credentials and appointments. It also involved refactoring the code base to identify and remove unused code, unnecessary customizations and irrelevant test cases and data.  Apart of this upgrade, the build process has been enhanced to handle the 12 Dev, 6 QA, 1 Stage and 1 Production environments along with the ability to configure SSO and automatically rollback.</li>

    <li><b>	Summary & Role:</b> UHC wanted the ability to collect administrative fees for New and Renewal appointments and paper applications of Non-Residents agents. We built a framework that supports the ability to charge the above fees and other types (e.g. eModel office applications, signature pads etc.) as well for future use. The “Direct Payment” DCM functionality which supports paying or charging non-commission related amounts was used to model solution. Other use cases like reversal of fees, partial fee charge to an agent, designating an alternate agent to be charged the fee and maintaining date effectivity around the rules that charge the fee were also implemented and delivered.</li>

    <li><b>	Summary & Role:</b> The objective of ITASCA (Insurance to Annuity System Consolidation & Administration) Program was to implement Outside Distribution (OD) Annuity new business sales of six products on the new policy administration system and setup distributor and agent details in Distribution Channel Management (DCM) for compensation purposes. This was a very complex project involving large number of disparate team and systems. We created necessary interfaces between DCM, Admin Server & other applications used for OD business (i.e. Web Book of Business, DTCC, Webservices, Data Power, FACTS etc…) and established appropriate accounting controls for OD compensation. We merged OD (named RiverSource) business into the existing infrastructure that manages ID (internal distribution) business and turned DCM into a “system of truth” for all distributor, agents, products (ID and OD), credentials and compensation rules such that cross selling and upselling as possible with these distributions.  The integration with Admin Server (policy admin system) handled myriad use cases involving calculating and paying of commissions (first year, trails, marketing allowances, assets under management etc…) based on the transactions loaded into DCM. For each of these used cases we also designed and delivered cancel and reconciliation processes to manage the exit and payout scenarios.</li>

    <li><b>	Summary & Role:</b> The iCOMP system is the institutional business source for compensation payments for Brokers and internal sales forces, including MetLife Financial Services and New England Financial Agents, as well as Retirement Benefits Funding Representatives.Successfully managed to upgrade MetLife to the latest and greatest product and platform versions.  Ensured MetLife realized the full value delivered by the product.  Also educated CTS (10 developers) on the know hows of the product and made them self- reliable. This helped MetLife save $200k annually for managing their daily operations.  Improved the performance of the nightly batch process from 22hrs to 14hrs by refactoring the code and tuning the non-performing queries. Also identified dependencies of jobs that could be altered to better suit the batch window timings. Finally improved the performance of credential validation processes by narrowing the criteria and yet abiding my compliance rules. In addition to the above, DCM at MetLife has been integrated with upstream systems that send policy transactions for GBR for Intermediary and Vantage for GVUL Groups.</li>
